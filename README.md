# React Authentication App

This is a simple React application that provides user authentication functionality. Users can log in by providing their username and password, and upon successful authentication, they are redirected to the dashboard page.

## Features

- User login: Users can log in using their username and password.
- Token-based authentication: Upon successful login, a token is received from the server, which is used to authenticate subsequent requests.
- Protected routes: Certain routes are protected, meaning only authenticated users can access them.
- Redirect to dashboard: Upon successful login, users are redirected to the dashboard page.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: A routing library for React applications.
- Fetch API: Used for making HTTP requests to the server.
- LocalStorage: Used for storing the authentication token locally.
